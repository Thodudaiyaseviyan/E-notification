 Our e-notification website caters to Indian citizens, particularly in Tamil Nadu, offering real-time updates on nearby government services. Users receive notifications about nearby ration shops, stock availability, government officials, and scheduled power outages, and can provide feedback on local issues, all accessible via GPS-based location selection.
